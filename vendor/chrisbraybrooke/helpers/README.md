# Laravel Project Helpers
A package that provides all of the helpers I generally use on all projects

## Installation

```
composer require chrisbraybrooke/helpers
```

## Setup
1. You should run `php artisan tinker stub:custom` to publish a set of opinionated stubs that will aide development. To overide previous stubs, the `--force` flag is available.

2. Config is available by running `php artisan tinker vendor:publish --tag=helpers-config`
